## 📌 Additional Notes

- It is important to consider that this was my first 'big' project. It was entirely realized in 6 months, the unexperience and short deadline made me do some parts not as optimal as possible or containaining bugs and innacuraccies. 
- Each project includes its own detailed `README.md` file inside its folder.
